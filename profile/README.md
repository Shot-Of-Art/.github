While Equifax does not offer a franchise-specific score like FUND, its services are integral to the lending process, providing detailed credit histories for franchisees ([Credit Score Information](https://www.equifax.com/personal/education/credit/score)). Additionally, Equifax's identity protection tools could be integrated into Shot of Art's franchise onboarding to safeguard franchisee data.

- **Protecting Owners and Voting Shares**:
  - To ensure high safety for owners and protect voting shares, Shot of Art should implement robust franchise agreements. Key measures include:
    - **Non-Compete Clauses**: Preventing franchisees from operating competing businesses within defined territories.
    - **Territory Rights**: Clearly defining geographic areas to avoid overlap and disputes, ensuring franchisee exclusivity.
    - **Voting Rights Structure**: Structuring the franchise system to limit franchisee influence on key decisions, such as through operating agreements for LLCs or bylaws for corporations, ensuring the franchisor retains control over strategic decisions.
  - These legal protections are crucial for maintaining brand consistency and protecting the interests of the original owners, Nadia Kuzmina and Ilya Kuzmin.
